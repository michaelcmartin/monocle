# Monocle
## A Minimal, Native Console-Like library based on SDL

Monocle is a platform for writing 2D sprite-based games that is designed to have as simple as possible of an API while still enabling works of great sophistication. It draws inspiration from YoYoGames's _Game Maker_ systems, as well as from the core engines behind the game projects I've worked on over the years (predominantly _The Ur-Quan Masters_ and _Sable_).

The project is still in the design phase, but is rapidly advancing towards cursory implementation of enough features to back a simple game. Resource management, basic rendering, sound, basic forward kinematics, basic input processing, collisions, controllable Z-Order, and custom rendering logics are all present. The only major piece left is high-level game flow ("scenes", "object contexts", or "rooms"). That's still being played around with.
