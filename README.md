# Monocle
## A Minimal, Native Console-Like library based on SDL

Monocle is a platform for writing 2D sprite-based games that is designed to have as simple as possible of an API while still enabling works of great sophistication. It draws inspiration from YoYoGames's _Game Maker_ systems, as well as from the core engines behind the game projects I've worked on over the years (predominantly _The Ur-Quan Masters_).

The project was abandoned in the design phase, but I've occasionally copied material out of it for other projects, so I'm keeping it around.  It's got basic functionality for resource management, basic rendering, sound, basic forward kinematics, basic input processing, collisions, controllable Z-Order, and custom rendering logics.
